Years later, the memories of those three transformative days still lift me up. And, of course, the phenomenal women I met: Arunima Sharma, whose journey continues to inspire me\u2014her LinkedIn posts are a constant source of motivation. It's such a beautiful coincidence that we\u2019re both embarking on our entrepreneurial journeys at nearly the same time. Meenakshi Dhanani, your comments and messages have always been a beacon of support, cheering me on unconditionally. Ayushi Mrigen, Juhi Bhatnagar, Akanksha Thareja and so many more from our cohort of Women Techmakers Scholars 2016\u2014your rise as tech leaders, simply by being your authentic selves, is truly inspiring. I'm deeply grateful for the connections we've forged and the inspiration you continue to provide. Thank you for being a part of my journey.\nI\u2019ve shared a lot about the process of making Poetcraft , but I haven\u2019t yet shared why I started it. Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills. That moment sparked something deeper\u2014a realization that writing in meter is a powerful experience, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to those with formal training. However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity. I\u2019m excited to continue this journey, to see where it takes me, and to help poets everywhere discover the joy and power of writing in meter, just as I did.",

Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills. That moment sparked something deeper\u2014a realization that writing in meter is a powerful experience, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to those with formal training. However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity.

I'm deeply grateful for the connections we've forged and the inspiration you continue to provide. Thank you for being a part of my journey.\nI\u2019ve shared a lot about the process of making Poetcraft , but I haven\u2019t yet shared why I started it. Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills. That moment sparked something deeper\u2014a realization that writing in meter is a powerful experience, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to those with formal training. However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity. I\u2019m excited to continue this journey, to see where it takes me, and to help poets everywhere discover the joy and power of writing in meter, just as I did.",

These remarks took a toll on my confidence and made it hard for me to continue doing what I love\u2014coding.\n\nThis year, thing started to turn around. With the help of therapy and a lot of perseverance, I've spent the last six months rebuilding my confidence and proving to myself that those negative words were lies. It's not always easy; some days, the comments come back, and I take a break. Other days, I push through and continue coding.\n\nI\u2019ve written a blog post about this experience, hoping it resonates with anyone who has ever felt like they didn't belong.

Thank you for being a part of my journey.\nI\u2019ve shared a lot about the process of making Poetcraft , but I haven\u2019t yet shared why I started it. Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills. That moment sparked something deeper\u2014a realization that writing in meter is a powerful experience, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to those with formal training. However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity. I\u2019m excited to continue this journey, to see where it takes me, and to help poets everywhere discover the joy and power of writing in meter, just as I did.\n",

Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked.

However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity.

I'm deeply grateful for the connections we've forged and the inspiration you continue to provide. Thank you for being a part of my journey.\nI\u2019ve shared a lot about the process of making Poetcraft , but I haven\u2019t yet shared why I started it. Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills. That moment sparked something deeper\u2014a realization that writing in meter is a powerful experience, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to those with formal training. However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity. I\u2019m excited to continue this journey, to see where it takes me, and to help poets everywhere discover the joy and power of writing in meter, just as I did.",

        "I'm truly amazed at how much this conference and the moments spent with these incredible women have shaped my journey\u2014something I didn't fully grasp at the time. Years later, the memories of those three transformative days still lift me up. And, of course, the phenomenal women I met: Arunima Sharma, whose journey continues to inspire me\u2014her LinkedIn posts are a constant source of motivation. It's such a beautiful coincidence that we\u2019re both embarking on our entrepreneurial journeys at nearly the same time. Meenakshi Dhanani, your comments and messages have always been a beacon of support, cheering me on unconditionally. Ayushi Mrigen, Juhi Bhatnagar, Akanksha Thareja and so many more from our cohort of Women Techmakers Scholars 2016\u2014your rise as tech leaders, simply by being your authentic selves, is truly inspiring. I'm deeply grateful for the connections we've forged and the inspiration you continue to provide. Thank you for being a part of my journey.\nI\u2019ve shared a lot about the process of making Poetcraft , but I haven\u2019t yet shared why I started it. Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills. That moment sparked something deeper\u2014a realization that writing in meter is a powerful experience, one that shouldn\u2019t be limited to those with formal training. However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts. Poetry had brought out something deeply human in all of us, and I realized that I cared about these people\u2014and others like them\u2014enough to fully commit to creating an app for poets. That\u2019s how Poetcraft was born, and I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with Annie Finch to bring this vision to life. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s a mission to make the magic of meter accessible to poets everywhere, breaking down the barriers of traditional literary education and helping poets explore the depths of their creativity. I\u2019m excited to continue this journey, to see where it takes me, and to help poets everywhere discover the joy and power of writing in meter, just as I did.",
        "Since the last two years, I have been struggling with self-doubt due to condescending comments about my capabilities in tech. These remarks took a toll on my confidence and made it hard for me to continue doing what I love\u2014coding.\n\nThis year, thing started to turn around. With the help of therapy and a lot of perseverance, I've spent the last six months rebuilding my confidence and proving to myself that those negative words were lies. It's not always easy; some days, the comments come back, and I take a break. Other days, I push through and continue coding.\n\nI\u2019ve written a blog post about this experience, hoping it resonates with anyone who has ever felt like they didn't belong.

Last November, I attended a workshop in the hills of Satkol, led by the amazing Annie Finch. Before this, I had published a chapbook of poetry but knew nothing about meter. As someone from a non-literature background, I was unsure if I could grasp such a complex concept. But that workshop changed everything. In the midst of writing in meter, something clicked. It felt like being in a beautiful song, and I found myself singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as I looked out at the hills.

However, I wasn\u2019t completely certain if I was connected enough to the poetry community to solve this problem for them. So, I attended another poetry retreat in Goa, led by the talented Rochelle D'silva. This retreat was a test\u2014could I truly connect with other poets and care enough to create something meaningful for them? By the end of the retreat, the answer was clear. I had bonded with six strangers from different professions and parts of the country. Through their poems, I saw pure and vulnerable parts of their hearts.

        "We live in times of great disaggregation, and yet, seem to learn increasingly from generalists. In the past, an expert in one field of Psychology might have been forced to teach a broad survey class. Today, you could have each lecture delivered by the world\u2019s leading expert.\n\nIn today's landscape, the notion of expertise has undergone a significant transformation, largely shaped by the accessibility and reach afforded by digital distribution channels. Previously, traditional gatekeepers such as newspapers, television networks, and publishing houses held sway over distribution channels. To gain access to their platforms, individuals often had to establish themselves as subject matter experts through years of dedicated study and practice. Only then would they be considered for opportunities to share their insights with the wider audience.\n\nHowever, the dynamics have shifted dramatically. Now, the focus has shifted towards building one's own distribution network rather than solely relying on expertise. By cultivating a following through online platforms, individuals can position themselves as experts, regardless of their depth of knowledge in a particular field.\n\nThis shift presents both advantages and drawbacks. On one hand, the removal of gatekeepers means that anyone with the charisma and marketing savvy can amass a following and be perceived as an authority. Conversely, this means that individuals with genuine expertise may struggle to gain recognition if they lack the skills to market themselves effectively.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with consumers to discern whether an individual's authority stems from genuine expertise or merely effective self-promotion. It's essential to conduct thorough research and critical evaluation before placing trust in purported experts. What are the best frameworks to do that?",
        "Ever since I began working in advertising, I\u2019ve noticed that we often attempt to address demand-side issues by increasing supply, leading to suboptimal outcomes. For instance, property crime decreases when people have access to essential services such as food, healthcare, and housing. Yet, we frequently focus on solutions like increased policing or harsher sentencing, which don\u2019t tackle the root causes.\n\nConsider the case of a chef aiming to boost revenue. They might add more tables or raise prices, which could yield short-term gains but would eventually lead to diminishing returns as tables sit empty. Another option might be to lower food costs to increase margins, but this would likely degrade quality, driving customers away over time. A better, albeit more difficult, strategy would be to improve the quality of the food, drawing in more patrons willing to pay a premium. Few take this route because it\u2019s the most challenging option, though it also provides the best long-term results.\n\nContent moderation on social networks presents a similar challenge. The more resources we allocate to policing content, the more users find ways to circumvent these efforts, continuing to share undesirable material. The problem isn\u2019t the supply of harmful content; it\u2019s the demand for it. Social platforms invest heavily in moderation because they cannot directly influence demand. While these investments are necessary to protect users, real progress hinges on societal changes, and until that happens, we need to moderate our expectations.\n\nThis parallels the situation in advertising. It\u2019s tempting to increase the availability of ad placements because this yields predictable returns. However, when demand remains constant, you\u2019re simply pushing deeper into lower-quality inventory and experiencing diminishing returns. A more effective long-term strategy is to focus on stimulating demand. While this approach is slower and harder to quantify, it enhances the value of the existing inventory and drives sustainable growth.",

Insertions :: word wasn't spoken, but output by the recognizer\n\nThe \"hallucinations\" described are insertions and substitutions. These errors always occur. The key is to understand at what rate and in what conditions. I suspect these are noisy audio files with background speech and cross talk. These conditions can be difficult for any speech recognition system, including the biological one between our ears.\n\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Please share examples if you have them!\n\nTo the organizations using Whisper in their products: \n\ud83d\udd18 Do you measure error rates on your own domain specific test sets? \n\ud83d\udd18 Do you track the error rates on said test sets? \n\ud83d\udd18 Do you gate new model deployment unless the model performs better on your data?\nFrom the article, I'm guessing not everyone does.....\n\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Just because it's free, doesn't mean it should be blindly deployed.\n\n\u2705 Do you want help? DM me!",
        "\"ex Tesla / Amazon / Google\" feels controversial. \n\n\"ex\" has such a negative connotation. \nAn ex is a person that you either don't want to contact, or shouldn't. Often there was hurt. Trust was broken. Even if your past employer fits that bill, why air it?\n\nI get it: you've done important work at a well known company. You want to signal that you can be trusted to do great work elsewhere. I want that too. Where you've worked can shape your career trajectory. \n\nConsider using \"prev\" or \"previous\". \n It's softer. \n Intentionally gentle. \n\nThoughts?",

I was born in Delhi, however I spent most of my formative years in a small district called Tehri Garhwal in the state of Uttrakhand owing to my father being in a transferable job.

However, this came at the expense of sinking an entire city; \u2018Old Tehri\u2019 ,displacing over 100,000 people from a place they called home. I witnessed firsthand the difficulties of living in an ecologically fragile environment, as my neighbors left their lives behind to make way for a new city. The town taught me the ability to find happiness in the smallest of things, while understanding the unpredictable nature of life.\n\nOver the next two years, my father underwent a transfer to the vibrant metropolis of Delhi, prompting our family to relocate to the bustling city. Delhi, in my perspective, emerged as a land of opportunities.

Throughout my school years, I immersed myself not only in scholastic endeavors but also in a plethora of extracurricular activities like Debating and Declamation.\n\nMy father's occupation at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) provided me with an early introduction to computers. I distinctly remember tinkering with the keyboard, making websites using basic HTML and giving myself a pat on my back whenever I was able to run the code successfully! Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT) emerged as a cornerstone in my higher education pursuits, giving me the avenues to explore my love for both programming and public speaking.\n\nAt MAIT, the Literary Umbrella, served as a central point for my interests around public speaking.

The primary aim of this initiative was to subdue the limitations students face while navigating their careers. Leading a team of 30 coordinators, we organized workshops, hackathons, and webinars focusing on emerging technologies and career preparation.\n\nMy experiences around student-led initiatives made me firsthand realize the value of perseverance and community support. Facing challenges such as sponsor rejections and managing logistics, I developed a profound appreciation for the collective effort required to overcome barriers and create positive change.\n\nAfter my graduation, I started working at ION as an SDE and was entrusted with the responsibility of developing and maintaining the ION Daemon- the heart of ION\u2019s microservice architecture. My responsibilities range from interacting with stakeholders for refining requirements to deploying new features in the production environments.
